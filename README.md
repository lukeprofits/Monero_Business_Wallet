# Monero_Business_Wallet

In progress. Do not use yet. 

## Mission Statement
The goal of this project is to reduce the barrier to entry for merchants, and increase acessability/usage of Monero by creating a simple, user-friendly way for merchants to accept XMR and receive USD. 

## Practical Goals

* Be incredibly user friendly

* Have the value sent by the customer (as XMR), and the value recieved by the merchant (in USD) lose less than credit card processing fees (3%).

* Remain as decentralized as possible.
  
* Include all useful tax information needed for merchants.

* Protect privacy as much as possible.
