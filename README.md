## Mission Statement
The goal of this project is to reduce the barrier to entry for merchants, and increase acessability/usage of Monero by creating a simple, user-friendly way for merchants to accept XMR and receive USD. 

# How It Works: 
* Launch the wallet
* Select if you would like to have recieved Monero auto-forwarded to cold storage, or converted to a stable coin and auto-forwarded to an exchange (where it can be sold for USD).
* Select additional privacy settings

# How To Use:
* Make sure you have [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer installed
* [Download the Monero Business Wallet files](https://github.com/lukeprofits/Monero_Business_Wallet/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) extract all the files from the .zip you downloaded and put them in a folder
* [Download the Monero CLI Wallet](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/#cli), extract all the files from the .zip you downloaded and put them in the same folder
  
* Optional: Download and install [the font Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans)
* On Windows, double click the "Windows_Launcher" file
* On Mac/Linux, run the "Mac_Linux_Launcher" file 
* Or if you are comfortable with the terminal, on any OS open your console and enter the command: `python Monero_Business_Wallet.py`
* On Linux there are some required clipboard packages. For non-wayland sessions they are: xclip and xsel, for wayland sessions it is: wl-clipboard. Make sure to install them with your package manager.
* Configure your settings & leave it running

## Practical Goals

* Be incredibly user friendly

* Have the value sent by the customer (as XMR), and the value recieved by the merchant (in USD) lose less than credit card processing fees (3%).

* Remain as decentralized as possible.
  
* Include all useful tax information needed for merchants.

* Protect privacy as much as possible.
